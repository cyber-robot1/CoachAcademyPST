# Level 2: Data Structures & Algorithms

## Info: 

This course introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. It covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, binary heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, basic analysis of algorithms.

It covers techniques for attacking and solving challenging computational problems. Fundamental algorithmic solving techniques covered include complete search, divide/reduce/transform and conquer, greedy and mathematics. 

Programming language libraries that are commonly used in problem solving will also be taught.
